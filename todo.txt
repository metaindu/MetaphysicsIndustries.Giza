parsing bug:
    subsequent skippable expression items aren't collectively skippable
    looks like the nodes aren't getting their nexts set correctly beyond the first follower

    >>> x = '[' 'a'? 'b'? ']';
    >>> parse x '[ab]'
    There is 1 valid parse of the input.
    >>> parse x '[a]'
    There is 1 valid parse of the input.
    >>> parse x '[b]'
    There is 1 valid parse of the input.
    >>> parse x '[]'
    There are errors in the input:
      Invalid token ']' at position 1,2 (index 1). Expected $implicit literal a, or $implicit literal b


coherent error handling
    error lists or exceptions?
    return errors or always use a parameters?
    return null when something fails (force caller to check return value and error list)?

tokenized parsing
    definitions and directives
    all of this is checked by ExpressionChecker
    some of it is checked by DefinitionChecker
    some of it also goes into GrammarCompiler and TokenizeTransform

    in all grammars, combinations of token, subtoken, and comment yield an error
    in a spanned grammar
        definitions, by default have no directives, which means that they ignore whitespace, mind case, and aren't atomic.
            test in GrammarCompiler
        ignore case, mind whitespace, and atomic perform as advertized
            test in SpannerTest
        references between definitions work normally, no matter what tokenizing directives are applied to either def
            test in GrammarCompiler
        directives have no effect on inter-definition references, as token, subtoken, and comment are ignored
    in a parsed grammar
        definitions, by default have no directives, which means that they ignore whitespace, mind case, and aren't atomic.
        in a nontoken definition
            ignore case applies to implicit tokens only (see below)
            test in ExpressionCheckerTest
            test in ParserTest
        in a token or comment definition
            atomic is automatic. adding it produces a warning
            mind whitespace is automatic. adding it produces a warning
            ignore case ignores case
        in a subtoken definition
            atomic is not automatic. adding it makes the definition atomic, and produces no warnings or errors
            mind whitespace is automatic. adding it produces a warning
            ignore case ignores case
        in an implicit token definition
            token is automatic
            atomic is automatic
            mind whitespace is automatic
            it is impossible to add directives
            ignore case is specified on the containing non-token def (see above)
                changes names from "$implicit literal value" to "$implicit ignore case literal value"
                changes names from "$implicit charclass \dabcdef" to "$implicit ignore case charclass \dabcdef"

resilience
    full analysis and tests for Spanner, Tokenizer, Parser
    full analysis and tests for other classes
    DefinitionChecker
        check that all defrefs point to defs in the same grammar?
        check for duplicate names
        more thorough analysis
    SpanChecker - more thorough analysis
style
    clarify distinction between a grammar and a collection of definitions
    Rename DefinitionRenderer to GrammarRenderer, rename methods, make it take a Grammar instead of Definition[].
    Convert all lists and arrays to IEnumerable<> ?
    rename DefinitionChecker to GrammarChecker ?

Define a grammar for Solus. Create a SolusGrammar class.
Create a SolusSpanner class around SolusGrammar. Put both classes into MetaphysicsIndustries.Solus.

re-org and add docs

Move rendering classes to a separate 'Rendering' assembly, and/or move classes for parsing into a 'Light' assembly.

operate on streams
    implement a spanner with a parser acting on single-char tokens, e.g.:
        InputElement
        InputSource<T> --> Tokenizer, Charizer

user-defined reductions

whitspace as tokenized def
    remove 'mind whitespace'
    what once was implemented as 'mind whitespace' can instead be a separate processing stage that ignores whitespace, e.g. for Fortran
